FinGuard: A Secure Financial System Built with Java + Spring Boot

I developed FinGuard, a comprehensive and secure financial system, providing users with key financial operations and robust security features:

Account Creation and Login with JWT Authentication.

Money Transfers between accounts, ensuring speed and security.

Withdrawals with balance checks and transaction management.

Deposits with full transaction logging for transparency.

Balance Inquiries accessible instantly for users.

Email Notifications sent for each transaction to ensure users stay updated.

Users can request transaction history files for detailed records.

Strong security using Spring Security to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

This project was designed to provide a fast, secure, and user-friendly financial system with a focus on scalability and integration potential.
